# Envoys.yml

# This is an example Envoys configuration file.
# You can add your own data as needed.

# Envoys are defined as keys with coordinates (x:y:z) and associated worlds.
# Each envoy location corresponds to a chest that will be created in the specified world.

# Example envoy location:
# "x:y:z": "world_name"

# Envoys:
#   "x1:y1:z1": "world1"
#   "x2:y2:z2": "world2"

# You can define more envoy locations as needed.

# Make sure to maintain valid YAML syntax.

Envoys:
  "100:50:100": "world1"
  "200:70:200": "world2"
